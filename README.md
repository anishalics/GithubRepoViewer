# Github Repo Generator

An Android application that uses the GitHub REST API to fetch and display a user's public repositories. Users can enter a GitHub username, and the app will display a list of repositories with their names and descriptions.

Features:

•	Clean and user-friendly interface.

•	Fetch data dynamically using Retrofit for seamless API integration.

•	Handles API rate limits and errors gracefully.

•	Supports both synchronous and asynchronous network calls.

This project demonstrates effective use of Retrofit, Gson, and RecyclerView for building dynamic Android applications.
